To create a build environment for the beagle bone black (i.e. the am3358-evm), source the am335x-init-build-env like this:
> source am335x-init-build-env

This will create a build folder named "am335x-evm" in the same directory. The script will then change directory into that
build folder with the build environment ready to build targets.

Note that this environment is currently intended to support development on a beagle bone black SOC platform, or a qemuarm
emulated environment. To build images for the qemuarm environment, precede the bitbake command with MACHINE="qemuarm".
